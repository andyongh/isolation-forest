# C Implementation of Isolation Forest

A high-performance, multi-threaded implementation of the Isolation Forest anomaly detection algorithm in C, with Python comparison tools.

## Features

- Multi-threaded tree construction
- CSV data loading
- Full anomaly scoring
- Memory-safe implementation
- Scikit-learn comparison
- Makefile build system

## Requirements

- GCC â‰¥9.0
- Python 3.8+ (for comparison)
- sklearn, pandas, scipy (Python packages)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/isolation-forest.git
cd isolation-forest
```

This complete implementation includes:

Production-grade C code with strict error checking
Complete build system
Automated testing pipeline
Comprehensive documentation
Cross-validation with scikit-learn
The implementation has been hardened with:

Memory safety checks
Thread safety
